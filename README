Secret Delivery was conceived as an easy way for clients to transmit server
passwords and other private credentials to a developer.

It is a simple web application that allows one to send gpg encrypted email
attachments using only a web browser.  When hosted on an https connection the
sensitive data is encrypted for it's entire transit through the internet.

Secret Delivery also allows users to import their gpg public key.  Other users
may then use it to send them encrypted messages. Email is always sent to the
email address in the selected public key's User ID.

Secret Delivery is Open Source (MIT License) and hosted at
